				I set up the TV and started playing. I don't really like nature and all of that, so I planned on staying inside, but as I started playing, something caught my eye outside the window. I quickly took my headphones off as I ran for the window to see exactly what was out there.</span>

				I got to the window as fast as I could and realized that there was an amazing deer standing right outside my house! I know that I don’t really like nature but there was something about this deer that was special.</span>

				“Hi Michael, come with me so I can show something amazing!” the deer exclaimed. I had no idea that animals could talk! I was startled at first, but I couldn’t give up the chance of talking to a deer.
				“Um, uh, yeah, I’ll be right there!” I was so confused but I quickly put on my shoes to go outside.</span>

				I followed the deer to the woods. I was unwilling to go in at first because I wasn’t used to being in nature, but I eventually went in. “I know that you don’t like nature too much, but I will change the way you view my home.” Said the deer.</span>

				I continued to follow this magical deer as we walked into an amazing green land filled with plants and beans. I could not believe that nature could have so many details. I ran and jumped across the leaves as I begin to realize nature’s greatness.</span>

				I then jumped onto an incredible pink fruit. It was filled with seeds and juice. How could these tiny things be so detailed and beautiful? We soon came to the end of our journey that I never wanted to end.</span>

				I could not wait to learn more about nature, but as I turned around to say goodbye to the deer, it was gone, and I woke up from my dream. I know it was just a dream but something about it felt so real. I decided to take a break from video games and play outside and get closer to nature. It was the best decision of my life.</span>
